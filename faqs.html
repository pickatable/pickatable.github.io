                <h2>What is<img style="height: 30px; width: auto; margin-bottom: -13px;" src="assets/icons/logo_black.avif" alt=" pickatable">?</h2>
                <p><b>pickatable</b> is a restaurant discovery platform offering a <b>50% off on food</b> on a table reservation for two, three or four people. The perfect solution for food lovers to explore something new.</p>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Easy. <b>Download the App</b> and search for a restaurant you want to try out. Select one of the available slots of the early tables and reserve it for â‚¬8. That's it!</p>
                <h2>What about the drinks?</h2>
                <p>Our deal is firmly 50% off on food only, drinks are <b>always full price</b>.</p>
                <h2>What if we are more than four people?</h2>
                <p>It's great to be together, and we're working on increasing the number of diners but for the time being, the maximum number of guests per table reservation is four, with only one table per group. <br><br>Adding extra tables unfortunately is not permitted. Stay tuned for more information!</p>
                <h2>How do restaurants benefit?</h2>
                <p><b>pickatable</b> is a win-win solution for customers and restaurants alike. We encourage customers to be the first to reserve a table during a generally quiet period of the day.</p>
                <h2>What if I'm late?</h2>
                <p>Because no one likes latecomers, the deal is no longer valid if you arrive more than 15 minutes late. This keeps things fair for both diners and restaurants.</p>
                <h2>What is the policy over public holidays?</h2>
                <p>Restaurants are entitled to choose days and times for "table picking". Availability on public holidays is entirely on them and isn't therefore guaranteed, but there's always hope in the universe.</p>
                <h2>How do I delete my account?</h2>
                <p>You can delete your account and all related data from inside the app by pressing Delete Account in your Profile tab. Otherwise, you can contact us using the email you registered and we will do it for you.</p>
