                    <h2>What if we are more than four people?</h2>
                    <p>It's great to be together, and we're working on increasing the number of diners but for the time being, the maximum number of guests per table reservation is four, with only one table per group. <br><br>Adding extra tables unfortunately is not permitted.<br> But hey, stay tuned for more information!</p>

                    <h2>How do restaurants benefit?</h2>
                    <p><span class="puffin-font">pickatable</span> is a win-win solution for customers and restaurants alike. We encourage customers to be the first to reserve a table during a generally quiet period of the day.</p>

                    <h2>What if I'm late?</h2>
                    <p>Because no one likes latecomers, the deal is no longer valid if you arrive more than 15 minutes late. This keeps things fair for both diners and restaurants.</p>

                    <h2>What is the policy over public holidays?</h2>
                    <p>Restaurants are entitled to choose days and times for "table picking". Availability on public holidays is entirely on them and isn't therefore guaranteed, but there's always hope in the universe.</p>
