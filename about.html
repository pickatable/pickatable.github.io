            <p>We founded Pickatable to revolutionize the way people discover and enjoy dining out. Our platform offers a unique opportunity for users to try new restaurants with 50% off their food bill during early dinner slots. By simply downloading the Pickatable app, customers can easily make reservations for two, three, or four people and enjoy a delicious meal at a great price.</p>
            <p>For restaurant owners, Pickatable is a powerful tool to bring in new customers by filling vacant tables during quieter hours. The discounted offering brings real people through the doors, creating positive word-of-mouth that leads to more business.</p>
            <p>The idea behind Pickatable comes from our combined experience in the restaurant industry. We wanted to create a win-win situation for both diners and restaurant owners by making it easier for everyone to discover great dining experiences.</p>
